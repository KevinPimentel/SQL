#In this example I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--How many orders placed in January?
Select COUNT(orderid)
From BIT_DB.JanSales

--How many of those orders were for an Iphone?
Select COUNT(orderid)
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Where product = "iphone"

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
Select acctnum
From BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderid

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
Select distinct product, MIN(price)
From BIT_DB.JanSales

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
Select product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Group By product
Order By revenue

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
Select sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
Select count(cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
From BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
Where Feb.Quantity>2

Select orderdate
From BIT_DB.FebSales
Where orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00'

SELECT location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate = '02/18/19 01:35'

SELECT sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate like '02/18/19%'

SELECT distinct Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Batteries%'

SELECT distinct Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Price like '%.99'

--Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
Select distinct location, COUNT(orderid)
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Where location LIKE "%NY%"
Group By location
Having COUNT(orderID)>2

--How many of each type of headphone was sold in February?
SELECT sum(Quantity) as quantity, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product

--What was the average amount spent per account in February?
Select AVG(quantity*price)
From BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust

--What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
select sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id

--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total? 
SELECT product, sum(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc 
LIMIT 1
